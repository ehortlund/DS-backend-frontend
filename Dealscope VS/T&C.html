Details of any such offers, including eligibility, duration, and terms, will be clearly stated on the "Plans" page of the Website or during the checkout process. You are responsible for reviewing and understanding these details before initiating or accepting any promotion. We reserve the right to modify or terminate promotions at any time without notice, but this will not affect ongoing subscriptions under existing terms. You may cancel Your subscription at any time through Your account settings or by contacting Us. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and no refunds will be issued for partial periods.
